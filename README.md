My first-ever C++ project! Just the start to fully gamify life :D

// name
Text-Based Leveling System

// why
I made this because I've always wanted to find a way to turn my life into a game so I can progress just like my favorite characters!

// how
I used Visual Studio and the help of online resources to find my way around C++ and bring something to life.

// struggles
Some extensions didn't work and felt like my functions were too lengthy and could have been cut down. I've learned that it's cleaner to make more small functions instead of having a few clunky ones that I can barely comprehend. Oh, and I should comment as well. I forgot to do that.

// what

This is a text-based system where you submit tasks to the program. Based on the difficulty, you get a certain amount of EXP.
Once you level up, the necessary amount of EXP to level up again increases. You also recieve 3 stat points to allocate to different stats.
Your progress saves in a text file.
I'll keep developing similar projects until my ideas come to fruition! Thanks for stopping by c:
