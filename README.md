My first-ever C++ project! Just the start to fully gamify life :D

This is a text-based system where you submit tasks to the program. Based on the difficulty, you get a certain amount of EXP.

Once you level up, the necessary amount of EXP to level up again increases. You also recieve 3 stat points to allocate to different stats.

Your progress saves in a text file.

I'll keep developing similar projects until my ideas come to fruition! Thanks for stopping by c:
